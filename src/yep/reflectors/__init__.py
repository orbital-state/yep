Reflection module.

A Reflector helps with parsing, reflecting and analyzing the structure of source code written in 
some general purpose programming language.

This allows to deduce the pipeline-like (or DAG) topology of the source code, which can be used to
generate a pipeline wrapper for a target platform.
